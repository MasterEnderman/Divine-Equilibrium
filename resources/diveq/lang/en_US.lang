#QUESTS

diveq.quest000.title.name=The Roof
diveq.quest000.description.name=I can only imagine all of the horrible things that may have happened to my potato, but I have bigger fish to fry. I need to get out of this place, whatever it is. \nWhen I look closely, I notice that there seems to be a small patch on what must be the ceiling that looks different than the rest of this dark room. Maybe it's a vent or something. I should try interacting with it to see if it does anything. (shift+left-click with an empty hand)

diveq.quest001.title.name=The Floor
diveq.quest001.description.name=This whole place smells like it could go up in flames at any moment with the smallest spark. For lack of a better idea I'm going to just (SLOWLY) punch the ground below me until something happens. If the entire place goes up in flames and this is how my life ends, well, we had a good run. \nJust maybe, though, it will be only enough to start a small fire that I can throw my little pebbles into to see if anything happens. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? It's not like I have any better ideas.

diveq.quest002.title.name=I Quit
diveq.quest002.description.name=For all my troubles, all I got was some bigger stones (this place is weird). These won't do me any good, and I can't find anything else that could possibly be useful. I knew it was hopeless. I don't want to just sit here until I die, I want to go out on my own terms... (stay in a fire for too long)

diveq.quest003.title.name=You're boned
diveq.quest003.description.name=Great, now I can break this big chunk of my old skull down into smaller bones (break with fists). Once I do that I can rig something together with these bones and that stone from earlier. That just might be strong enough to break me out of here. \n\nÂ§o(To craft a bone pickaxe, open your inventory, click either your bones or cobblestone, then hold shift, drag it on top of the ingredient that you didn't pick up, and click again)

diveq.quest004.title.name=Burned field
diveq.quest004.description.name=I'm free! Well, not really. I escaped the dark room I woke up in only to discover that I'm stuck in some sort of empty void. On the plus side, this ability to start fires wherever I want is proving to be quite handy. I should keep lighting different things on fire to see where it takes me.\nIn fact, that gives me an idea. Perhaps I can light my old bones on fire to make some sort of light source.(Throw a bone into fire)\n\nWhile very morbid, these bone torches seem to be a suitable light source. Interestingly, they also don't appear to go out. I wonder if this is related to my new regeneration powers.\nNow that I can see better, I can take a closer look at the stone in the ceiling. It doesn't appear to be any stone I've ever seen - well, I suppose nothing about this experience has been normal so far.\nSomething about this stone feels especially odd, though. It's as if it's ever so slightly pulling on me, at my bones. I can't quite explain it. Maybe it has some sort of mysterious powers as well. I should get a better look from the top and experiment with it. I know, I'll use the cobblestone that I got from it! Magic stone plus magic stone must yeild something, right?(Place cobblestone on top side of bedrock)\n\nHmm... nothing's happened yet. Maybe I can try using my bone torch to light it on fire.(Left-click the cobblestone with bone torch in hand)\n\nWoah! The stone in the ceiling catalyzed the fire and burnt the cobblestone to a crisp, making it brittle. I wonder if this could be useful.

diveq.quest005.title.name=Cut yourself
diveq.quest005.description.name=I'm starting to get pretty hungry. If only I had my potato. Well, the only thing to eat around here is... myself... this is going to suck.\n\nI need to make a knife. First, I'll need a handle. If I sharpen one of these bones on a pebble, it should yield a suitable handle.\n\nBreaking the charred cobblestone gave me gravel. I should use a fire to separate out the remaining pebbles and see if there's anything useful in this gravel.\n\nI now have a piece of flint. A rather sharp piece of flint at that. I can now craft this with the sharp bone to make the knife. Now then, which organs were the non-vital ones? (Shift-rightclick with the knife in hand to trade health for meat.)\n\n(Pro-tip: The knife does anywhere from 2-3.5 hearts of damage, so if you want to minimize dying, don't use the knife until you have at least 4 hearts.)

diveq.quest006.title.name=Dirty Harry
diveq.quest006.description.name=Maybe I should work towards growing crops as a more reliable (and less painful) source of food. The first thing I'll need is dirt to grow them on, but without any dirt around I'll need to make my own. Maybe the ceiling stone can help with that.\n\nThe charred stone I made before could work as a decent base. I can add some of my flesh to it for nutrients (right-click flesh on charred stone that's on bedrock). Lastly, I need a fertilizer. I can grind down a sharpened bone on the ceiling stone into a powder and add it to the mixture.

diveq.quest007.title.name=Let it grow
diveq.quest007.description.name=As I sprinkle the pulverized remains of my past skull over the mixture of stone and my flesh, the mixture transforms into dirt. Great, just what I needed! I knew there was some knowledge up in this 'ol noggin.\n\nWhen I picked up the dirt, I found a book with strange symbols on it buried underneath, laying just ontop of the ceiling stone. Picking up the book, I feel something within my mind. Some sort of static that's barely audible without being sound at all, as well as hushed, unintelligible whispers. It becomes very hard to focus. The strange symbols on the book change, rearranging and distorting themselves. Slowly, the symbols turn into words.\n\n"Elemental Research and the Arts of the Arcane"\n\nThe static and whispers stop, and I can focus again. It was as if the book was scanning my mind. I don't know how, but I can sense that this book is incredibly powerful.\n\nI open the book to a random place. The left page is mostly blank, though there are a few of the symbols that I don't understand. On the right page, there are drawings in purple ink, showing two symbols and arrows pointing from the symbols to some sort of plant. A plant! Food! Potato!\n\nWith this, my vision blurs. The static and whispers return, louder now. I feel some part of my mind stir, as if somehow this book is manipulating my thoughts. My vision snaps back into focus, and the noises abruptly stop.\n\nI now have a small headache, yet some part of my mind feels... warm? What did that book do to me?\n\nThe page I was looking at has changed. It still shows the plant, but now, instead of a symbol, it shows a pile of dust with a label reading "Bone Meal" and an arrow pointing from this dust to the dirt that the plant is on.(If you don't have enough research to unlock the gamestage, just keep placing and breaking the dirt block and/or jump around a bit)\n\nWelp, it's not food, but wood might still be useful. This wood looks pretty strange. I shall name it Mystery Wood. Creative, right?

diveq.quest008.title.name=What?
diveq.quest008.description.name=Where am I? I uh... this uh... this can't be good. This can't be good at all. Why is it so dark? I'm not even quite sure which way is up.

diveq.quest009.title.name=Hmm
diveq.quest009.description.name=Okay... I need to think back to this morning to try and figure out how I got here. Let's see now... my alarm woke me up at 7:00 a.m., I got up, took a shower, got dressed, brushed my teeth and went on my daily walk to work. Actually wait, before I left for work I grabbed a potato to eat on my lunch break.\n\nHmm.. I'm really hungry now, where did my potato go? I don't remember ever eating it, and it doesn't seem to be in my pockets. Where is my potato? :(

diveq.quest010.title.name=RIP
diveq.quest010.description.name=What? I'm not dead? I see my old body just laying there, but I'm standing right here in a different body. Things are making even less sense then they did before, but maybe I can take advantage of my new found regeneration power. Maybe if I try reducing my old body to bone I can use it for some sort of tools. The first step would be to get all of the excess material off by tossing my old head in a fire.

diveq.quest011.title.name=Solidified Earth Knowledge
diveq.quest011.description.name=The third of the pages has the title "Earth", and shows yet another figure holding some sort of tool and breaking what appears to be dirt. Wait, no, it's a rock? Wait a minute... The object that the figure is breaking keeps changing as I blink, but all of them appear to be similar to the Earth. Again, this is followed by the figure producing another symbol.

diveq.quest012.title.name=Solidified Air Knowledge
diveq.quest012.description.name=Remember how I said my mind feels warm? Well not only that, it somehow feels expanded. I can sense some new part me, deep inside of my mind. Not only new knowledge that I didn't have before, but also a new capacity to learn things I couldn't before. It must have come from the book.\n\nIf I want to have any chance of escaping this... whatever this is, I should get a better sense of what I'm dealing with. I open the book to the first page, hoping to find a table of contents. After more static as the page translates itself, it appears to be exactly that. The first entry reads, "Fundamental Elementals," and spans three pages. It's as good a place to start as any.\n\nThe first of those pages has the title "Air". Under that, drawings show a figure jumping followed by it producing yet another glyph. Can I manifest something by jumping?\n\nWhat... what is this thing? It's air, but it's more viscous; it stays in my hand when I hold it, yet it moves around and pools in some places while dissipating in others. It doesn't seem to have any weight, but it sticks to my hand in a way. It even seems react to my hand movements. Perhaps this can be used as a tool.

diveq.quest013.title.name=Solidified Fire Knowledge
diveq.quest013.description.name=The second of the pages has the title "Fire", and shows another figure in a fire and producing another kind of symbol. This doesn't seem very pleasant...

diveq.quest014.title.name=Magnifying Glass
diveq.quest014.description.name=I'm definitely going to need water if I want to survive to get out of here. I can try to extract water out of the leaves, but I have no way of getting them. However, this turf seems to have some moisture in it. I just need to dry it out to extract the water. That'll be tricky with it being perpetually night, so I'll need to magnify what little light there is. If I carefully cut some of this scorch glass into a lens, I can stack them ontop of whatever I want to melt. 2-8 of these lenses should be enough.\n\nThe elemental book starts vibrating again. Oh good, another book! This time it glows a dark purple. After the same ritual as last time, it produces a book that reads:\n\n"Book of the Well: First Edition"\n\nOh joy, there's multiple editions of this one.

diveq.quest015.title.name=Scorch Glass
diveq.quest015.description.name=Underneath the fire shard is a sand-like material, which can be refined into what looks like some sort of primitive glass.

diveq.quest016.title.name=Turf Block
diveq.quest016.description.name=Underneath the earth shard is a meshy green substance that looks sort of like dirt. However, it seems that this not-quite-dirt can be turned into dirt, which is a significantly more convenient way to obtain it.

diveq.quest017.title.name=Moonstone
diveq.quest017.description.name=Let's see what this air essence thing can do. The next section of the book is labelled "Elemental Refining and Imbuing". The first page shows many symbols going through a fire and coming out as some sort of crystals.(Must have solidified fire knowledge unlocked first)\n\nInteresting. The air condensed into a shiny yellow crystal. The next page shows the shards being able to imbue a stone to transform it into something else. Underneath this are images that describe the process of making a suitable stone to imbue. The stone must have certain carvings as well as a relatively smooth surface. I can probably accomplish this with a piece of flint.\n\nAfter marking the carved stone with the correct pattern using the yellow shard (right-click the stone with it), the book opened to a page full of symbols that I still can't read. However, the symbols start flying out of the book, manifesting themselves into the space around the stone. The whispers start again, picking up until they're practically yelling in my ear, while the symbols swirl around this rock core. The sphere of symbols shrink around the core, and a bright wave of light temporarily blinds me. As it fades, I can see the stone has become white and smooth, and seems to slightly reflect the light from the stars in the perpetually-night sky.

diveq.quest018.title.name=Make it balanced
diveq.quest018.description.name="It's balanced, because it takes effort" - Slowpoke

diveq.quest019.title.name=Solidified Water Knowledge
diveq.quest019.description.name=With water, it seems I can now collect water essence. The elemental book say that I can get this essence by... drowning myself? Why must everything be obtained by harming myself. (Must have earth_1 researched)

diveq.quest020.title.name=Actually pretty light
diveq.quest020.description.name=I need a stronger material to work with, some sort of metal that I can use to make tools and equipment. Maybe that new Book of the Well has info on something.\n\nHmm, this should do. After some searching, I found a pseudo-metal listed simply as "Heavy," which I can use for some other tools. In order to make an ingot of Heavy, I'll need some clay and charred bonemeal.

diveq.quest021.title.name=Golden Leaves & Magic
diveq.quest021.description.name=Some of the leaves from these MysteryWood trees are golden! I wonder what magical properties they hold.\n\nApparently I can use these for some sort of ritual. I can imbue wooden logs to make wooden stands, and I can put these stands in some sort of pattern for these rituals.\n\nAfter crafting the last of the wooden stands, the book starts vibrating in my back pocket. Taking it out, it's also glowing a dark green color. The book suddenly flies from my hand and floats above the bedrock, glowing brighter by the second. The book opens to the page showing how the wooden stands can be used for rituals. The pages then turn back and forth, too fast for me to register what pages they're flipping to. The book starts vibrating more rapidly, and it becomes impossible to focus on it. Then it starts calming down, but something's different: there are now two books. The new book is the shade of green that the original one was glowing. They both rest on the ground, and I pick up the new book.\n\n"Book of Natural Aura"\n\nI now wonder how many of these books I'll accumulate before I escape back to my normal life, if that's even possible.\n\nOne of the first pages shows the pattern that I need for these rituals.\n\n(Clarification: You need a fully grown tree in the center, not just a sapling)

diveq.quest022.title.name=See the Aura
diveq.quest022.description.name=There's a strange entry in this Elemental Research book named "Aura Manipulation." Intrigued, I turned to it, but there's only one section. Actually, there are a few blank pages after it, until the next entry in a different part of the book. The lone section is titled "Aura Visualization and Sensing," and shows a ritual to make an item that looks too similar to an eyeball. There's not much description as to what this Aura stuff is or what I can do with it, but it might be a useful tool for later.

diveq.quest023.title.name=More Trees
diveq.quest023.description.name=It appears that I can transmute this mysterious tree into another kind of tree. This new tree has properties that can be used for more mystical processes that I don't really understand./n/nThis tree doesn't seem to grow here on its own, perhaps because this is such a strange environment. I certainly think so. Maybe I can infuse the air with its own essence to help it grow. I'll need to extract some of the oil from this tree, so I should make two saplings. I can squeeze one into oil and grow the other one with that oil.

diveq.quest024.title.name=Eternal Flame
diveq.quest024.description.name=It's not much, but it can help make this barren place seem more homely.(Light it with a Flint and Steel.)\n\nAnother book? This one reads "Book of Crows: First Edition." This book seems to be of spellcasting and other magical phenomenon.

diveq.quest025.title.name=The One Probe
diveq.quest025.description.name=One of the indices of the elemental book catch my attention: Extrasensory Visual Inspection. Flipping to that page, it appears that I can perform a ritual to get an item that acts as some sort of sixth sense, which lets me know the name of whatever I look at. With so many new items that I've never seen before, this sounds pretty convenient.

diveq.quest026.title.name=Crushing
diveq.quest026.description.name=This Heavy substance sure lives up to its name. I can probably use this to make some sort of crushing block.\n\nGreat, now if I throw an item on the ground and drop this crushing block high enough over that item, it should, well, crush it. It's just going to be backbreaking work to keep lifting this.\n\n(Protip: This pack uses Carry On. You can pick up the Crushing Block with shift-rightclick (default - can be changed in controls) so you don't have to break it every time you want to use it.)

diveq.quest027.title.name=Squeezing and Drying
diveq.quest027.description.name=A squeezer will be helpful as a lesser crushing block, either pulverizing items or extracting liquids from them that I can use. The drying basin can then infuse things with those liquids.\n\n(Protip: Place the drying basin next to the squeezer in order to automatically transfer liquids from the squeezer to the drying basin. The squeezer will also need a redstone signal to reset it after you squeeze something. Try making a button or lever and placing it on the side of the squeezer.)

diveq.quest028.title.name=Growth Candle
diveq.quest028.description.name=This oil should do the trick in allowing these Frankincense trees to grow. They also boost the growth of other plants, though I don't really have any other plants around as of right now. Once it's made, I can mix this into the wax of a candle and burn it. I'll need to replace the oil after a while, though it should be easier to do this once I get the first tree grown.\n\nÂ§c!ATTENTION! If you break a Growth Candle it'll convert back to a normal Candle.

diveq.quest029.title.name=Where do I go now?
diveq.quest029.description.name=One of the entries of the Elemental Research book has kept me going for quite some time now, and I think I'm finally ready to start the process. Titled "Dimensional Translocation", there appears to be only one section to it named the "Gaia Homeworld." There doesn't seem to be a portal for it, it just shows some sort of mystical apple. I vaguely remember Gaia being a Greek god of the Earth or something, so maybe whoever made this book named Earth the Gaia Homeworld? I don't know, but it's my only lead to get back home. I have to take it, or else I'll be stuck here forever. The only thing that worries me is that there's barely any description of this place in this entry; in fact, there are several blank pages after this before the next section starts. Why would there be blank pages? Are there hidden entries that I can't see yet?\n\nÂ§c!ATTENTION! Before completing this quest, make sure you are ready. It's pointless to bring your base with you, but you may want to complete any other remaining quests in this chapter before moving on.

diveq.quest030.title.name=Time to make Glass
diveq.quest030.description.name=I need something to carry smaller amounts of water. The bucket is good and all, but it's much better at carrying a larger amount of water. Something like a bottle will do, which I can carve out with glass, but first I need glass. I'll need to crush down stone enough to resemble sand, and then fire it up.

diveq.quest031.title.name=Water Transport
diveq.quest031.description.name=I need something to carry water. I can probably make a wooden bowl and mold these Heavy ingots over it to make a bucket. (You can make planks by breaking logs with the flint knife. Also, you cannot make an infinite water source.)

diveq.quest032.title.name=I'm blue...
diveq.quest032.description.name=Underneath the water shard is a blue rocky material that the book calls Azurite, which can be used to craft a container that can store liquid.

diveq.quest033.title.name=More Bones
diveq.quest033.description.name=There has to be a better way to get bones without constantly dying. Every time I die, I feel more and more depleted, as if I come back with slightly less of myself. This book has become my lifeline now; it must have the answer.\n\nOn the page with the shards, it shows that I can burn the moonstone into anther kind of shard, which can be imbued onto a rock core. This core can then be used to transform glass into bone! Perfect! But now how do I get glass?

diveq.quest034.title.name=Take some Air with you
diveq.quest034.description.name=I can use this new Frankincense wood as a cork to seal liquids in a bottle.\n\nOdd, I had nothing in these bottles, but when I put the cork in, the inside of the bottle remains as dark as the sky, even when held up to a light.(Rightclick with a Bottle and Cork in the Air to collect the surrounding air.)

diveq.quest035.title.name=What is this place?
diveq.quest035.description.name=As I bite down into the apple and swallow, my vision slowly fades, first to black, and then into a hazy grey, as if I'm standing in a dense fog. I still feel awake, but I can't move. The fog slowly fades away, and I realize that I'm staring at the sky again. Actually, the sky doesn't seem to be as dark, and the ground below me is softer. I sit up and look around, and I see that I'm in a dense forest as the sun slowly crests the horizon, sending the forest into dawn. Am I home? Is it finally over? My pockets and backpack are empty, and the sky is no longer permanently midnight, so maybe that was all a dream? How did I sleepwalk into a forest?\n\nAs I try to gather my wits about me and start to stand up, something still feels very weird. The air is really hard to breathe. It would be impossible if it weren't for the Gaia Ring I made earli- wait a second, I still have all of my rings. It's not over after all, is it. But I still don't know where I am. What's going on? Did the apple thing work then?\n\nWhat the... I'm on a floating island! Where am I!?

diveq.quest036.title.name=Need to breath
diveq.quest036.description.name=I can infuse a ring with the air around me, allowing me to breathe easier where it's harder to breathe.\n\n(Protip: This ring does NOT work underwater.)

diveq.quest037.title.name=Burn all the things
diveq.quest037.description.name=Now that I have this Heavy, I can now make a fire starter with some flint, which will make burning things easier. I should watch out for the trees, though.

diveq.quest038.title.name=Now cut other things
diveq.quest038.description.name=I need to make something sharp to harvest these leaves. Once I do, making water will be much easier, as I can just extract water from the leaves.

diveq.quest039.title.name=Destroy those Trees
diveq.quest039.description.name=Now that I have a tree, I should make something that's more effective at chopping it. But despite my best efforts, I can't split a rock into the right shape for an axe. Maybe I can use that new air essence stuff on a pickaxe to form the head into an axe head.\n\nAs I bring my handful of viscous-air-that-I-still-have-no-idea-what-it-is to my pickaxe, I try to concentrate on what an axe head looks like. The slurry of air engulfs the pickaxe head and starts swirling around it. It spins faster and faster around the stone, and to my surprise the stone starts to warp. Er, is it starting to liquify? No, it's somewhat dissolving in the air, quickly eroding and being carried around by the air. As more of the stone pickaxe head is dissolved, some of the particles also settle back onto the handle and solidifies back into stone. After some time, the slurry dissipates, and my crude pickaxe is now a crude axe.\n\n(Pro tip: You can use excavation to chop down trees easier. You can also throw a *full-durability* primitive axe in fire to upgrade it.)

diveq.quest040.title.name=Miner's hate that trick
diveq.quest040.description.name=Haste is the way to go

diveq.quest041.title.name=Getting back on Track
diveq.quest041.description.name=Finally I'm able to craft some basic Tools now. Let's go mining.\n\nBreaking Leaves while holding a piece of Flint sometimes yields some Sticks.

diveq.quest042.title.name=Alternative Food Source
diveq.quest042.description.name=Alright, I've had enough of eating myself! Now that I can harvest these leaves, I can make a sort of salad out of them. Time to go vegetarian.

diveq.quest043.title.name=Lost your Questbook?
diveq.quest043.description.name=Get a new One.

diveq.quest044.title.name=Questbook doesn't work?

diveq.quest045.title.name=Even better Food
diveq.quest045.description.name=The leaves of this new tree smell pretty nice. I wonder if they taste good as well. I'll use them to spice up my salads./n/n(These salads give a regeneration buff when eaten.)

diveq.quest046.title.name=Storing Liquids
diveq.quest046.description.name=Now that I can make water, I'll need something to store it in. I can use this Azurite to make a tank for this.

diveq.quest047.title.name=Resource Collection
diveq.quest047.description.name=Well, whereever my items went, now it's not the time to sit here and wait until something happens. Maybe I should try to create some basic tools again to further explore this place.\n\nCollect some Gravel with your bare hands and throw it into a nearby puddle to obtain some flint. Smash the flint against some stone to break it into small pieces.

diveq.quest048.title.name=Time to hunt
diveq.quest048.description.name=By making a knife you get access to more resources which might be needed later.

diveq.quest049.title.name=Herbs
diveq.quest049.description.name=While wondering around I found some Lakes underground with some mossy cobblestone. Try to carve some of the moss with your knife.\n\nÂ§o(rightclick the mossy cobblestone with the knife)
